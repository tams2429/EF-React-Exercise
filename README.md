# React Exercise

The exercise is to create a small web page based on the design provided and the data you can find in `~/src/data.json`.

The data will include a list of components that need to be stack on top of each other to assemble the design. 

You will see the structure and the require React components have been already created and imported within `~/src/components/App/index.js` file. You will need to add the rquired markup logic and css.

The main feature of the page is the show/hide cards button.
Once you created the page and applied the correct style. Add the required logic for the button to "toggle" the visibility of the cards component on and off.  


> *Please note: Both the CSS and the React aspects are equally important in evaluating the code.*
You will not be able to see exact mesurements from the design (font family, px sie, height width etc). Please rely on your design skills to get the closest as possible to the mock for both desktop and mobile
